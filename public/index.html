            <div class="faq-question">Q: I found an in-game ad!</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                No worries! If there is an in-game ad on an official Spark game (affiliated with Spark), simply create a
                bug report ticket by pressing the üè¥ button in the bottom toolbox. If the game is not affiliated with
                Spark,
                then we
                unfortunately cannot do anything. Play on!
