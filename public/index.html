        <h1 id="about-title">FAQ</h1>
        <p class="about-text" id="faq-text">
            Q1: I found an in-game ad! <br>
            A1: No worries! If there is an in-game ad on an official Spark game (affiliated with Spark), simply create a
            bug report
            ticket by pressing the üè¥ button in the bottom toolbox. If the game is not affiliated with Spark, then we
            unfortunately
            cannot do anything. Play on!<br><br>
            Q2: Where do you get your games?<br>
            A2: Spark gets its games from various sources, but mostly from open-sourced games.<br><br>

            Q3: Where can I get in contact with Spark?<br>
            A3: Just join the Discord Server! <a
